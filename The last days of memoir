i remember when i was a soldier 
the beginning days were brutal 
and i lost every ounce of humainity in me because of the hard and callous trainings
initially i wanted to quit but some force i could not explain usually held me back 
at a time quitting was nol longer a option because whenever i rememvber how far i 've come 
the only option would be to persevere till the end
